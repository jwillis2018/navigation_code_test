# Basic HTML Navigation Example
This example demonstrates the basic accessibility features you will want to build into your basic HTML documents so that the audience knows where they are and how to get to other content in the site. 

Features include:
- Accessible page titles. Always lead with the page name followed by site name.
- Skip to main content links that allow the audience to jump past repetitive navigational elements to the main content of the page.
- Semantic markup for main navigation (unordered list inside a nav)
- H1 tags indicating the page name
- Use of aria-current to indicate what page the audience member is on
